Feature Ideas for automodel:
  
Variable transformation option for outcomes (box-cox? What I already know)
show all output, or stop on a violated assumption (boolean option, but hand checking assumptions makes this hard, may not be doable)
output for glm logistic regression, with compact output formula (done but need some extras)
spss output options (saving variables, different plot) maybe collapsed into one 'verbose' option. (not sure what to do with this at the moment)

To do list:
bookkeeping tasks:
Clear up warnings and stuff from package check output (got everything but the latex errors stuff)
get file exclude list clear

code tasks:
revise and refactor if possible, all the functions (not sure what I meant by this, but it seems quite general)
Eliminate the use of the modified lmSupport function, by replacing it with my own attempt to replicate that object creation
Check the accuracy of partial regression plots (in fact, compare 1-1 with spss output for the same model) (will do some comparative checks with SPSS when all's said and done)
Allow to select number of data points to display to check for outliers, with default value that is low.  Or allow to save as a variable (this should not be hard)
Allow user to choose more Verbose names to be used in lieu of the column names for the output

MEGA TASK ::::::
IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE KNITR OUTPUT DOCUMENTS PRETTY??????  
IE. In lieu of the standard output tables in the code output windows, can I have a nicely formatted latex-y table ?
(this is the thing that could become something big..., use to up my github profile)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For 

```{r}
summary(cars)
write.csv(freeny, file="freeny.csv")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
