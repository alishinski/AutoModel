Feature Ideas for automodel:
  
Variable transformation option for outcomes 
Model formulas listed under summary table
show all output, or stop on a violated assumption
output for glm logistic regression, with compact output formula
spss output options (saving variables, different plot) maybe collapsed into one 'verbose' option.

To do list:
bookkeeping tasks:
fix examples so they work (use the tests file)
Clear up warnings and stuff from package check output
get file exclude list clear
fix the global variable situation with assumptions_check

code tasks:
revise and refactor if possible, all the functions 
Eliminate the use of the modified lmSupport function, by replacing it with my own attempt to replicate that object creation
Check the accuracy of partial regression plots (in fact, compare 1-1 with spss output for the same model)
Allow to select number of data points to display to check for outliers, with default value that is low.

Other:
create an invisible list return object from the main function like lm, or modelCompare

MEGA TASK ::::::
IS THERE A WAY TO MAKE KNITR OUTPUT DOCUMENTS PRETTY??????  
IE. In lieu of the standard output tables in the code output windows, can I have a nicely formatted latex-y table ?


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For 

```{r}
summary(cars)
write.csv(freeny, file="freeny.csv")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
