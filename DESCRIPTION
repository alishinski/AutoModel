Description: A set of functions to automate the process and produce reasonable output for hierarchical multiple regression models.  The user specifies predictor blocks, from which the functions generate all of the linear models, and provides output enabling the user to check the assumptions of the overall model.  Binary logistic regression models are supported in addition to standard linear models.
